# Machine Learning - Ancient *Kuzushiji* Text Recognition
Kuzushiji, a ancient form of cursive writing that is used for centuries prior to 19th century Japan. Majority of historical documents that exist in the archives of Japan are written in this form of writing. Therefore, it would be great to have a model that could transcribe ancient Kuzushiji scripts into modern characters for researchers to understand what is recorded.
